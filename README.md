# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project predicts the price of laptops based on various features such as brand, RAM, storage, processor type, and more using supervised machine learning techniques. It is designed to help consumers and retailers estimate prices more accurately based on specifications.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Laptop prices vary significantly depending on specifications and brand. This project uses regression algorithms to build a predictive model that estimates laptop prices based on features extracted from a dataset.

---

## 📊 Dataset Features

Typical features used:
- Brand
- Processor
- RAM Size
- Storage Type and Size
- GPU (if available)
- Screen Size and Resolution
- Operating System

> Note: Dataset preprocessing includes handling categorical variables, missing values, and feature scaling.

## 🔁 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing irrelevant or duplicate entries

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding
   - Outlier removal

3. **Model Building**
   - Regression algorithms like:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge / Lasso
     - Random Forest Regressor

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
   - Cross-validation

5. **Prediction**
   - Real-time input test cases for price prediction

---

## ✅ Results

The final model provides a reasonably accurate estimate of laptop prices with minimized RMSE and optimized R² scores. The Random Forest Regressor (or whichever performed best in your case) showed the best performance on test data.
